Q1: Hello World!
* What is c++?
C++ is
     -- an object-oriented programming language
     -- it was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup
     -- it is an extension of C programming language
     -- it is intermediate-level language as it comprises both high-level and low-level language feature

* #include<iostream>
  Here # sign is used to signify the starting of preprocessor command, #include is a preprocessor commands, and this is used to include all the code which will be      written inside the file included inside the angle brackets <> into the source code.

* using namespace std;
 we write "using namespace std" at the starting of the code because, there is c++ standard library which included the working of common functions and classes like "cout"
"cin", "string" etc..., if we do not include "using namespace std" at the starting of the code then whenever we write these name like "cout", "cin", "string" we need to write std:: before those name, so to  avoid this repetition of writing std::, we write "using namespace std" at the starting of the code.

* main() function is called by the operating system whenever the program is executed.


Q2: Variable and Types
 *Data Types
  Int-4 bytes
  Long-8 bytes
  Char-1 byte
  Boolean-1 byte
  Float-4 bytes
  Double-8 bytes

*If we want to print the float or double type value, and we want specific number of decimal places then we need to use:
#include<iomanip>
cout<< fixed << setprecision(3) << varaible_name << endl;

*Varible: Variable are container to hold data

Q3: Type Conversion
   Type conversion means we convert the data type of a value to another data type.
   There are two types of type conversion:
   i) Implicit conversion ------------> apne ap type conversion ho jata hai
   ii) Explicit conversion ------------> hum explicitely batate hai ki konse data type mai type conversion krna hai


Q4: Math Library
c++ math library can be accessed using #include<cmath>
--> Square root ---> sqrt(val)
-->Powers----> pow(val, 2)
-->Trigonometry --> sin(val) cos(val) tan(val)

Q5) File Handling
 Files are used to store data in a storage device permanently
ofstream: stream class to write on files
ifstream: stream class to write from files
fstream : stream class to write from/to files


Default Open Modes:
ifstream   ios::in
ofstream   ios::out
fstream    ios::in | ios out


Q6) Random Numbers
    we can generate random number using the function rand();
