Q1) Structures
    Structure in C++ are user defined data types which are used to store group of items of non-similar data types.
    Example: 
           struct Employee
           {
            string name;
            int id[5];
            float salary;
           };

          int main(){
            Employee e1;
            e1.name = "Tina"
            e1.id = 336;
            e1.salary = 5000;
          }
     * When a structure is created no memory is allocated.
       The structure definition is only the blueprint for the creation of variable. You can imagine it as a datatype
     
     Structure in C++ contains two types of members:
     Data Member: These are normal C++ variables.
     Member Functions: These are normal C++ functions.


Q2) Classes and Objects
    Class:
    A class is a user-defined datatype, which has its own data members and member functions.
    Class in C++ are the blueprint of Object.
    
    Object: 
    Object is an instance of Class.
    Whenever a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when an instance of class is created, memory is allocated to that instance.

   Access Modifiers:
   There are 3 access specifiers in C++.
   Public: Members declared as public can be accessed from outside the class.
   Private: Members declared as private can only be accessed within the class itself.
   Protected: Members declared as protected can be accessed within the class and by derived classes.


  Member Function in C++ Classes:
 We can define member function in 2 ways:
 Inside class definition
 Outside class definition---------> we have to first declare the function prototype in the class itself, then we have to use scope resolution:: operator
