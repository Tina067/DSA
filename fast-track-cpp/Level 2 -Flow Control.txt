Q1: Comparison Operation & If-else
    Comparison Operation: Comparison Operator are used to compare two values. The return value of comparison operator are either 0 or 1 i.e(True or False)
    Operator          Name                         Example      Return Value
    ==                Equal to                     5==6          False
    !=                Not Equal                    5!=6          True
    >                 Greater Than                 5>6           False
    <                 Less Than                    5<6           True
    >=                Greater than or equal to     5>=6          False
    <=                Less than or equal to        5<=6          True


   Logical Operators:
   Operator           Name                Description                 Example              Return Value
   &&                Logical and         Returns true if both         1<2 && 2<3             True
                                         statements are true    
   ||                Logical or          Returns true if anyone       1>2 && 2<3             True
                                         of the statements are true  
   !                 Logical not         Reverse the result           !True                  False


  Conditional Statements:
  The two general types are: 
  i) if...else
  ii) Switch...Case

  i) There are three forms of if...else statements in c++
      1) if statement
         if(num%2==0)
         cout<<"The given number is even";

      2) if...else statement
         if(num%2==0)
         cout<<"The given number is even";
         else
         cout<<"The given number is odd"

      3) if...else if ...else statement
         if(num%2==0)
         cout<<"The given number is even";
         else if(num%2==1)
         cout<<"The given number is odd";
         else
         cout<<"Enter a valid number";



Q2) Switch Statement
The switch statement allows us to execute a block of code among many alternatives:
switch(expression){ -----------> The expression is evaluated and then compared with the values of each case label
case 1: 
//Line of code
break;

case 2: 
//Line of code
break;

case 3:
//Line of code
break;

default:
//Line of code

}

Q3) Conditional or Ternary Expression
    (condition) ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse
    The first expression will be evaluated if the condition is true, and the second expression will be evaluated of the condition is false


Q4) Loops
    Loops are used to repeat a block of code again and again
    There are three types of loop:
    i) for loop
    ii) while loop
    iii) do...while loop

    i) for loop
       for(initialization; condition; updation) {
       // block of code
       }

   ii)  while loop ------> if the condition is true then only the control will go inside while block
      while(condition){
      //block of code
      }

   iii) do while loop----> In do while loop the code will run atleast once and then the conditions will be checked and based on that the code will execute
        do {
         //block of code
        }while(condition)

Q5) Jump Statements
  Jump statements are used to interrupt the normal flow of the program.
  There are three types of Jump Statements:
  -->break ---------> break statement is used to come out of the loop
  -->continue-------->when compiler finds continue statement, compiler will skip all the following statements in the loop and resume the loop
  -->goto  ----------> goto statement is used to jump from one point to another point
