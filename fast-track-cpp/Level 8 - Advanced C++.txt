Q1) Cpp Exception Handling
    Exceptions are runtime abnormal conditions that are met during the program execution.
    With the help of exception handling we can transfer the control from one part of the code to another part of the code.
    It handles runtime error.

    * Types of C++ Exception
      Synchronous: These exception happens due to mistake in the input data.
      Asynchronous: Disc failure, keyboard interrupts etc...


     * Throw , Try, Catch
     Throw : Whenever we encounter an exception, that exception can be thrown using "throw" Keyword.
     Try: Inside Try block, we will put the block of codes that may throw exception.
     Catch : Catch is a block of code, and the catch block will execute whenever an exception is thrown from the try block.


Q2) Policy Based Data Structure:
    There are two functions:

    find_by_order()---------->value at particular index
    Example:  
   // value at 2nd index in sorted array
    cout<<*X.find_by_order(2)<<endl;

    order_of_key()------------> index of a particular number
    // index of number 7 
    cout<<X.order_of_key(6) <<endl;


Q3) Bitset:
    operator[]: Access bit
    count: count bits set
    size: Return size
    test: Return bit value
    any: Test if no bit is set
    none: Test if no bit is set
    all: Test if all bits are set
