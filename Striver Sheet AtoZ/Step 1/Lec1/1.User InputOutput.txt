--> Initially it is important to grasp the big picture and build a strong foundation.
-->Including Libraries : C++ is a versatile language and it relies on libraries to access various 
functionalities.
#include<iostream> ------> input and output operations
#include<math.h> --------> allows us to use mathematical functions.

--> The Generic Skeletion: It consist of two main components: Library inclusion and main function.
#include<iostream>
int main()
{
    // Your code here
    return 0;
}

-->Output with cout: cout<<"Hey Striver!;
--> For line break \n is more preferred than endl
--> using namespace std: By adding "using namespace std" at the beginning of the program, we are telling
    the compiler that we want to use all the names from the std namespace without explicitly specifying
    std:: each time

--> Taking User Input using cin
-->#include<bits/stdc++.h> : To make the process more convenient, there is a shortcut that allows
 to include all the standard libraries at onces using #include<bits/stdc++.h>
